This is the TapeDeck Bosque Library. Currently, this project holds the transpiled C++ arranged in a way that
it builds within the CPP crate for Rust. TapeDeck is the repo which, when combined with this one, will allow
for running the code. The transpiled C++ is dynamically generated by the modified BosqueRuntime found in the
TapeDeck repo. 

The first project which really caught my attention in regards to dynamically generating IR was
the Julia Labs creation [Cassette.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLabs/Cassette.jl) hence the name TapeDeck
