This is the TapeDeck Bosque Library. Currently, this project holds the transpiled C++ arranged in a way that
it builds within the CPP crate for Rust. TapeDeck is the repo which, when combined with this one, will allow
for running the code. Currently, this repo contains one application pre-compiled into rust. All this application
does is wait for input (from a modified Bosque Runtime) and output a message. This is a proof of concept that it can
be done.
